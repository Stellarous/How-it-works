# How it works

How it works is an attempt to find out how things works in the fields of theoretical computer science and computer engineering. I use different languages, technologies and tools to explore the mechanisms, procedures and functionalities. I try to explain these things in different ways and with different aproaches beside formal and informal explanations.
